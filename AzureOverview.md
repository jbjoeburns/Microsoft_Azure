# Structure

Resources need to be contained within a resource group.

Resource groups are associated with subscriptions, that limit you on what you can create within resource groups depending on how much you pay.

Management groups can set policies that affect everything below it.
- However, policies can be set at each level too, that filter down to levels below them
- Management groups have layers/levels too

Each of these layers is called a **scope**
